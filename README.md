The art of predicting the sale price of homes in Iowa using multiple linear regression and other good stuff.

TODO:
## Simple modelling
  * Simple multiple linear regression model
  * Diagnostics
  * Outliers
    - Removing levels with few or no observations
  * Skewness
  * More Feature engineering. Not all information is explained
    - Remove low variance variables
  * Check diagnostics again
## More advanced modelling
  * Lasso
    - Diagnostics
  * Ridge
    - Diagnostics
  * Use glmnet
## Final Models
  * Report the summary: parameter estimates, standard errors, confidence intervals, and p-values
  * Interpret
  * Compare models
    - Partial F-tests
    - Residuals and diagnostics
    - Cross-validation (or other measures of prediction error)
    - Use the test sample to get an estimate of the generalization error of your final model.
